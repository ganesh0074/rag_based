eneral elections are being held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven phases, to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha. The votes will be counted and the results will be declared on 4 June 2024.

This is the largest-ever election in history, surpassing the 2019 Indian general election, and lasts 44 days, second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election. The incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, is running for a third consecutive term.

Approximately 970 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people are eligible to vote.[1][2][3] The legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim are to be held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.

Background
Contemporary politics and previous elections
India has a multi-party system with two major parties, namely the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress dominating the politics at the national level. The Bharatiya Janata Party has governed the country with Narendra Modi at the helm since 2014. The tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha is scheduled to end on 16 June 2024.[4] The previous general election was held in April–May 2019, after which the, National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, formed the union government, with Modi continuing as Prime Minister.[5]

Electoral system
Article 83 of the Constitution of India requires elections to the Lok Sabha to be held once every five years.[6] All 543 elected MPs are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.[7] The 104th amendment to the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the Anglo-Indian community.[8]

Eligible voters must be Indian citizens, 18 years or older, ordinary resident of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or equivalent.[9] Some people convicted of electoral or other offenses are barred from voting.[10] Indians holding foreign citizenship are also barred from voting. There is no postal or online absentee voting in India; members of the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home constituencies in order to cast a ballot.[11]

For the 2024 election, 968 million people are eligible to vote, an increase of about 150 million people from the 2019 election.[12] In Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station will be set up for the only registered voter in the village of Malogam, due to electoral laws that stipulate voting booths to be placed within two kilometers from all settlements.[13][14][15] Polling stations will also be set up inside a wildlife sanctuary in Kerala and in a shipping container in Gujarat,[16] as well as in 320 relief camps hosting some 59,000 people displaced during interethnic violence in Manipur.[17]

In March 2024, the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress Party to end the usage of electronic voting machines and revert to paper ballots and manual counting, which was the system used in elections until the late 1990s, with the party citing risks of electoral fraud.[18] Nearly 5.5 million electronic voting machines will be utilized for more than one million polling stations, while 15 million election workers and security personnel will be tasked with managing the conduct of the election.[15]

Planning

Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar announced the 2024 General Elections schedule for Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies during a press conference
Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involve monitoring campaign expenditure, preventing the circulation of illicit goods, and ensuring adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. In the final 48 hours before voting, campaigns come to a halt, and measures are implemented to maintain order and prevent disruptions. On polling day, strict rules are enforced to prevent undue influence, ensuring a smooth and secure election process. Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are sealed and stored with tight security measures, while Booth Level Officers assist voters throughout the process. Meticulous planning is essential to ensure that elections are conducted freely, fairly, and peacefully.[19]
